# GoGrow - React Native Code Test

The purpose of this exercise is to give you a chance to demonstrate your
problem solving and coding skills. The exercise is split into two sections:

First you will complete the tasks below at home; if you are successful in the
first part, you will be invited in for an interview where we will discuss your
solution and try to add to it. This is primarily a web development exercise so we
can see how you deal with React Native, consuming an API and Redux managment and CSS styling; bear that in
mind when completing the exercise.

## The tasks

This exercise is intended to build a simple mobile app by using React Native.

The requirements are:

- Create a React Native project from scratch
- Set up redux and linters
- Create a view to allow the user to log in to the app 🔐
  - This login should be mocked and errors should be displayed if the data submitted is incorrect
    - user: admin
    - password: admin
- Create a view to allow the user to register a person (only logged users should see this view and no authentication or api requests are needed to create the person) 📝
  - The required fields are:
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Profile picture 📷
    - Gender (male, female, other, undisclosed)
    - Date of birth
    - Address - ideally use google places autocomplete 🧭
  - Once a person is submitted, that person should be listed at the same view with an option to edit/remove

## What we are looking for

- Good understanding of React Native
- Good understanding of JavaScript/Typescript
- Good understanding of CSS
- Good understanding of Redux/Context.

## Note

Feel free to user any styling library 😛
